SATIRE (Simulating Andrew Trotman's Information Retrieval Environment)
is a small, experimental, retrieval system designed to support
experimentation with impact-ordered indexes, and score-at-a-time
processing with early termination.  It consists of an indexer i and a
query processor q.  To reduce implementation effort in the initial
phase, terms and documents are both referenced by integer numbers.

INDEXER:  Takes a file of quantised T-D scores in tab-separated-value (TSV)
format and produces a binary index file which has an impact sorted
posting list for each of the terms.  The expected input format is one
line per term.  Each line has the following format:

line ::= <term-id> TAB <score-run> ...
term-id ::= <integer>
score-run ::= <score> <run-length> <doc-id> ...
score ::= <integer>
run-length ::= <integer>
doc-id ::= <integer>


In the index, each postings list closely matches this format. It
consists of a series of runs comprising a run header (score,
run-length) followed by a series of docids.  Required parameters
include the number of documents, the number of terms, and the number
of bits required to represent the range of quantised scores.  Options
allow the postings lists to be sorted by descending score.  (Otherwise
it is assumed that the postings are sorted in this order.

INDEX FILES:  .cfg -   (txt) records the options used in building the
                        index.	      
	      .vocab - (binary) A table of 64-bit offsets to the
                        start of postings lists in i.pl
	      .if -    (binary) The postings lists in the format
                        described above.  Starting on single-byte offsets.
			 

QUERY PROCESSOR: Takes an index built by the indexer i, and a set of
queries in the format requested by Bhaskar.  Produces a set of results
in the format requested by Bhaskar.   Required parameters are the stem
of the index files, the number k of results required per query, and
the limit p on the number of postings accessed in processing a query
(early termination control).
